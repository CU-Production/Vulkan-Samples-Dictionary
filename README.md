# Vulkan Samples Dictionary

Vulkan Samples Dictionary is a project that includes both vulkan examples written in C++ and a ReadTheDoc page served as a dictionary introducing each examples.

## Purpose

This project aims to provide people who use Vulkan an efficient reference place, which I believe it can smooth the learning curve and reduce the costs of using Vulkan API to build useful compute/graphics products.

Currently, you can find some good resources to learn Vulkan. But no one can be used as an efficient reference and we are introducing them here (Current Vulkan resources) to help you understand why this project maybe more helpful than them for reference as well as in case you donâ€™t know these places.

## Design Principles

* *Easy to build*:
  
  Each samples only has its own CMakeList.txt file and one source file with several shader files.

* Small topics:
  
  Entry level samples focus on correctly using API commands (Within 500 lines);

    Mid level samples focus on small use cases like triangle rendering (Within 2000 lines);

    Upper level samples focus on relatively large and common topics like deferred rendering (Within 5000 lines);

Introduction
-------------
This is a simple example used to illustrate how to create a ``Render Pass``, ``Color Attachment`` and ``Depth Stencil Attachment``.
Then, the example would connect attachments to the ``Render Pass``. Even though color image and depth-stencil image are created, they
aren't used in this example. It would print the first physical device's device name.

An Example Output
-----------------
``Device name:AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT``

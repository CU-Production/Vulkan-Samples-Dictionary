Plans:
- Make a camera that can be controlled by the mouse to look around. (Use the Game Editor's Camera model.)
- Map the HDRI into the background so the camera can sample the background HDRI image.
- Still use the DearImgui for mouse event management. --> So, I should use the DearImgui Triangle as the base to change.

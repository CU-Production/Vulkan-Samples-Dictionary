Plans:
- Make a camera that can be controlled by the mouse to look around. (Use the Game Editor's Camera model.)
- Map the HDRI into the background so the camera can sample the background HDRI image.
- Still use the DearImgui for mouse event management. --> So, I should use the DearImgui Triangle as the base to change.

We may still need the MVP camera -- Camera's viewing direction. In addition, we may also want to know the screen space coordinate of the pixel. So, a quad that covers the whole viewport should be enough. By using the inverse of the mvp matrix, we can get the world position of the pixel in the frustrum. Then, we can calculate a direction out. Then, we can use this direction to get the uv coordinate that can be used to sample the image.
